# Domain 2 Key Points

- **Protecting Secrets in Memory**: It’s tough to keep secrets safe in memory since they often end up decrypted on the memory block.

- **Tracking Inventory**: The easiest way to keep tabs on your inventory is to make sure new devices get added during the procurement process, before you deploy them.

- **Certificate of Sanitization**: This certificate can help you tackle “data remanence” issues, making sure old data doesn’t linger around when it shouldn’t.

- **Declassification Costs**: Avoid “declassification” because it can get pretty expensive. 

- **Data Retention Policies**: These policies help minimize your legal risks by ensuring you only keep what’s absolutely necessary for a reasonable amount of time.

- **PII Alert**: A student ID counts as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), so handle it with care!

- **PCI DSS**: The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) offers guidance on security controls and standards to protect cardholder data.

- **Data Classification Review**: If the value of your data changes due to legal, compliance, or business reasons, make sure to review and possibly reclassify it.

- **Asset Owner**: This is the person responsible for managing the lifecycle of assets.

- **Business vs. Data Owners**: Business owners usually go for COBIT to balance security and regulatory needs, while data owners pick the controls.

- **Clearing Media**: This means prepping media for reuse—basically, unclassified data gets written over. It’s safe for the same security level.

- **Erasing vs. Deleting**: Erasing is really just deleting data.

- **Purging**: This is a more intense cleaning process, used to bring media down to a lower security level.

- **Sanitization**: This is the ultimate way to ensure no data can be recovered, but it can be pricey. Sometimes, it’s just easier to buy new equipment!

- **Data Remanence**: Spare sectors and bad sectors can lead to data remanence, so keep that in mind.

- **EOS (End of Support)**: When you hit EOS, your enterprise might decide it’s time to change out devices.

- **EOL (End of Life)**: Even if a device is EOL, there might still be some support like updates for a limited time.

- **Support Phases**: Remember, the end of support is the last step after the end of sale and end of life phases.

- **Digital Signature**: This is what validates that someone has approved the data or report. Super important for authenticity!

- **Asset Tagging**: Tagging assets helps individuals know the security level of the asset and the data. For instance, someone with Secret clearance shouldn’t be messing with a Top Secret device.

- **Roles Overview**: The business owner manages processes, while the data owner has ultimate responsibility for the data itself.
