# Domain 3 Key Points

- **Incipient Stage**: This is the earliest point where you can spot a fire. Catching it early is key!

- **CCTV**: It's one of the best secondary verification controls.

- **Privacy by Design**:
  - It's proactive—think ahead about privacy.
  - Always respect users' privacy.
  - Ensure visibility and transparency in how data is handled.
  - Aim for full functionality while maintaining privacy.
  - Implement end-to-end security to protect data from start to finish.

- **Grid Computing**: Isolation breaches are the worst! If an attacker isolates one machine, it can lead to significant problems.

- **Microservices**: These bad boys rely heavily on APIs. They allow different services to communicate effectively.

- **System High Mode**: Users need valid clearance and access approval for any data processing. Remember, it’s all about that “need to know” basis!

- **Data Remanence in IaaS**: Vendors need to handle data remnants responsibly, but customers should also check that the sanitization process is solid.

- **Key Exposure**: If you find a key has been exposed, generate a new one ASAP!

- **Digital Certificates**: These use serial numbers on the certificate revocation list (CRL). It’s how we keep track of what’s still valid and what’s not.
