# Domain 4 Key Points

- **IPSec** is a amazing for security. It provides confidentiality (keeps your data secret), access control (who can see what), authentication (verifying identities), and non-repudiation (nobody can deny).

- **VDOMs (Virtual Domains)** are basically like virtual firewalls. They let you create separate environments on a single firewall device. 

- **DDoS attacks** Consider using CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) as an alternative to a dedicated mitigation service. They can help absorb the traffic!

- **VLANx** lets you create Layer 2 connections over a Layer 3 network.
- 
- **High-performance computing** over Ethernet is called **InfiniBand**. It’s super fast and designed for data-intensive tasks.

- **Edge computing** pulls the network closer to the user. It means you get faster access to data and applications because they’re right there, instead of all the way back in a central data center.

- **Double NAT** Cannot be done. Dont get confused.

- **Syslog** or **NetFlow** is what you use for diagnostics. They help you keep track of what's happening in your network and troubleshoot issues.

- **SMS messages are never encrypted** by default. So, if you’re sending sensitive info, you might want to use a more secure method.

- **SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)** and **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)** are used for monitoring network devices and performance.
