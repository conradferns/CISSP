# 📘 CISSP Gotchas

## 🚀 Intro
We all know the saying about Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) exam being "an inch deep and a mile wide." By the end of my preparation, I had so much information packed in my head that some concepts were blurring together. So, I put together this list of points I needed to solidify.

> **⚠️ CAUTION:** This is not a replacement for thorough prep! It’s just my personal list of gotchas you might find useful to check against your own knowledge. There's no substitute for your own notes and full prep! 😊
